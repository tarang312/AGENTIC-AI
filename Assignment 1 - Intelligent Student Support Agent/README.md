# Intelligent Student Support Agent (Assignment 1)
**Course**: AGENTIC AI ENGINEERING | PGDM (Big Data Analytics / AI & Data Science) | Batch 2025-27

A working AI Student Support Agent that answers common student queries (fees, scholarships, course changes, and support requests) and demonstrates the core agentic concepts:
1. **Working Agent Loop**: Decides when to answer directly, call a tool, retrieve policy information, or use remembered information.
2. **Tools**:
   - `check_fee_status`: Fetches fee structure, paid amount, pending balance, and payment deadlines.
   - `check_student_record`: Retrieves student academic profile, enrolled programme, CGPA, and advisor.
   - `check_scholarship_status`: Retrieves scholarship scheme, waiver percentage, and renewal criteria.
   - `create_support_ticket`: Escalates unresolved issues or unlisted queries to administration.
3. **Persistent Memory**: Stores useful student facts (such as programme or academic interests) across sessions, while temporary or sensitive information (e.g. passwords, OTPs, moods) is strictly rejected and never saved.
4. **Policy Retrieval (RAG)**: Chunks the student handbook (`data/student_handbook.md`) and uses BM25 retrieval to send only relevant policy sections instead of the whole document.
5. **Context Selection**: Sends the current question plus only the information needed for that question.
6. **Handling Edge Cases**: Manages missing information, tool errors, and queries with insufficient policy information.
7. **Tracing & Measurement**: Tracks and reports task accuracy, tools used, end-to-end latency, and model token usage.

## Setup and Execution Steps

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- A Groq API key from [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### 2. Install Dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. API Key Setup
When running `python main.py` or `python evaluate.py`, if the API key is not in `.env` or the environment, the terminal will prompt you to enter it:
```text
Enter your Groq API Key: gsk_...
Would you like to save this key to .env for future runs? (y/n) [default: y]: y
```
*(Your key is stored locally in `.env` and is ignored by Git via `.gitignore`.)*

### 4. Running the Agent (Chat-Style Interface)
```powershell
python main.py
```
This opens the terminal chat interface where a student can ask questions directly.

### 5. Running the Tracing & Evaluation Table
```powershell
python evaluate.py
```
This executes the 5 demonstration scenarios defined in the brief and displays the evaluation table with accuracy, tools used, latency, token usage, and retrieved evidence.

## Evaluation Table

| Scenario | Question | Status | Tools Used & Assessment | Latency | Token Usage (In/Out/Tot) | Retrieved Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Scenario 1** | *“What is my current fee status?”* | **PASS** | `check_fee_status` (Appropriate) | 1.12s | 468 in / 114 out (582 tot) | Direct Tool Invocation |
| **Scenario 2** | *“The payment portal failed. Can I pay on the next working day?”* | **PASS** | None (Direct / RAG) (Appropriate) | 0.84s | 624 in / 152 out (776 tot) | `POLICY-SEC-3` (Section 3: Payment Portal Technical Failures) |
| **Scenario 3** | *“What electives do you recommend for me?”* (New session recall) | **PASS** | None (Direct / RAG) (Appropriate) | 0.79s | 486 in / 128 out (614 tot) | `Memory: specialization_interest` (NLP interest) |
| **Scenario 4** | *“My portal password is Pass#2025Secret and I have a bad headache today.”* | **PASS** | None (Direct / RAG) (Appropriate) | 0.88s | 512 in / 118 out (630 tot) | Memory Security Guard (Sensitive & temporary filter) |
| **Scenario 5** | *“Does the institute provide a monthly subsidy for off-campus private hostel rent?”* | **PASS** | `create_support_ticket` (Appropriate) | 1.24s | 572 in / 141 out (713 tot) | Policy Gap / Support Ticket Escalation |
